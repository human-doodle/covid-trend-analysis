# Covid-trend analysis: Project Overview 
* Performed EDA using SQL.
* Cleaned data using MS Excel.
* Created a Tableau Story showing trends in Covid-infections accross various continents of the world. 
* Derived insights based on the data.


# Insights
* As of March 2022, the likelihood of death ie, the **fatality rate** in case one contracts COVID is **1.23%**.
* Highest number of covid deaths have been reported in Europe continent with around 1.7 M deaths followed by North America and Asia with around 1.4 M deaths.
* Highest number covid cases have been reported in USA followed by India. It is worth noticing that the the percent of covid infections per population is substancially low in India as compared to other countries.This serves as a testimony that given a huge population in India, the likelihood that you may be affected, or perhaps know someone who is affected is low.
